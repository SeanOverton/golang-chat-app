# Go chat CLI

I made a CLI chat app because I wanted to understand scaling services that have stateful websockets.

# Simulating a scalable architecture locally

The main topic this project demonstrate was a scalable architecture for a system that uses websockets to communicate with clients.

<!-- The setup we are tring to achieve locally is here. (Image generated by) -->

## How to set up

1. Build server image.

`cd server`
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t golang-chat-server .`

2. Run docker compose to spin up 2 servers and rabbitMQ.

`docker compose up`

3. In 2 new terminals, start 2 respective clients connecting to the seperate servers.

`cd client/src`
`go run main.go localhost:8080`
`go run main.go localhost:8081`

4. Happy chatting.
